# permutation-py
A short python script to create permutations of a list.

**NOTE:** This doesn't actually show all permutations when n > r. I found this out when attempting to do the same thing in Rust. The fix is in the rust version: [permutation-rs](https://github.com/stdonnelly/permutation-rs/tree/main).

This was mainly created to mess around with recursion. There are two arguments: elements and r. elements the list to create permutations of. r is the number of elements in the permuted lists. The output will be as list of permutations.
